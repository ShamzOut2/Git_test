# Architecture

```
 iRacing ──shared memory──▶ telemetry thread ──topics──▶ hub ──WebSocket──▶ overlay pages
 (60 Hz, IRSDKDataValidEvent)  Engine::tick()       (dedupe,      (/ws)     (desktop windows,
                                                     only if                OBS browser sources,
 mock simulator ─────────────▶                       subscribed)            settings panel)
```

## Goals

- **Lightweight.** One small native process does the work. Overlays are static pages of about 45 KB that only update
  text and attributes that actually changed. No framework, no virtual DOM, no per-frame allocations in the hot UI path.
- **Smooth.** The telemetry thread wakes on iRacing's *data valid* event, so it runs at the sim's 60 Hz with no
  polling jitter. The browser batches messages into one render per animation frame.
- **Customisable.** Each overlay declares a settings schema. The settings panel renders forms from it, and the values live
  in `config.json` as free-form JSON, so adding an option never needs a backend change.

## Pieces

### `crates/irsdk`
- Parses the `irsdk_header`, variable headers and telemetry rows from byte slices. The same layout is used by `.ibt` files,
  which makes IBT replay a small step later.
- `SharedMemory` (Windows) maps `Local\IRSDKMemMapFileName`, waits on `Local\IRSDKDataValidEvent`, and copies the
  newest buffer. It re-checks the tick count after copying, so a row torn by the sim writing mid-copy is never used.
- `yaml` is a tiny parser for iRacing's session string. iRacing writes driver and team names unquoted, which can
  include `:` and `#`, so it reads every value to the end of the line instead of using a general YAML library.

### `crates/core`
- `model`: normalised `Telemetry` and `SessionInfo`. Sources fill these, and nothing downstream knows SDK variable names.
- `source::iracing`: the live source. Variable handles are resolved once per connection.
- `source::mock`: a deterministic three-class race on a synthetic circuit. It emits YAML that goes through the real parser.
- `engine`: derived state recomputed every tick:
  - running order and positions per class (live progress in races, best lap otherwise)
  - gaps to the leader and to the car ahead (estimated-time based, lap-aware)
  - per-car lap history, pit stops and stint length
  - `fuel` (consumption per lap and the race-length estimate for lap/time races and lapped cars)
  - `weather` (wetness and rain trend), `tyres` (wet/dry advisor), `battle` (gap trend by least squares)
  - `trackmap` (outline recorder: integrates heading over distance for a clean lap, closes the loop and caches per TrackID)
- `league`: user-defined classes and driver overrides that replace iRacing classes everywhere.
- `topics`: serialises each topic. Payloads are rounded so unchanged data serialises identically, and the hub drops duplicates.
- `hub`: topic fan-out, subscriber counts (a topic is only built while someone watches it) and host events for the desktop app.
- `server` (axum): serves the embedded UI and `/o/<id>` pages, plus the `/ws` protocol:
  - client → server: `sub`, `unsub`, `setEditMode`, `setVisible`, `drag`, `resize`, `setConfig`, `patchOverlay`, `resetTrackMap`,
    `setIracingApi`, `importLeague` (progress comes back on the `leagueImport` topic)
  - server → client: `{"t": topic, "d": payload}`
- `engine::ratings`: the live iRating estimate (community formula, computed per iRacing class), a rough SR estimate, and league points.
- `corners`: a background worker that downloads corner data for the current track from Lovely Track Data and caches it. Corners you edit in the config take precedence.
- `iracing_api`: the iRacing Data API client (OAuth password-limited grant with masked secrets, following the S3 `link` indirection) and the league importer.
- `lookup`: flair → ISO country code (for flags) and car → manufacturer.
- `garage61`: a background worker that maps the current iRacing car and track to Garage 61 IDs and fetches your PB and your teams' best laps.

### `apps/desktop` (Tauri 2)
- Runs the core in-process and opens one transparent, undecorated, always-on-top, **click-through** window per
  enabled overlay. In edit mode the windows take the mouse; the overlay page asks the host (over WebSocket) to start a native
  drag or resize, and new geometry is debounced into the config.
- Tray menu, global hotkeys, single instance, and a settings window that is the same page as `http://127.0.0.1:8182/`.

### `ui`
- `src/overlay.ts` is the host page for one overlay: it applies the theme and settings and feeds topics to the overlay.
- `src/overlays/*` hold one file per overlay, each exporting an `OverlayDef`, and `registry.ts` lists them.
- `src/control/*` is the settings panel (overlays with live previews, theme, strategy, league builder, Garage 61, general, OBS).

## Data budget

The relative with 21 rows is about 6 KB per frame and the standings with 20 cars about 10 KB, all over localhost. Topics nobody subscribes to cost nothing.
The track outline (about 8 KB) is only re-sent when it changes.
